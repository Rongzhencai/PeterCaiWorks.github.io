      Every day on his way home, Jake passes by a rest area in front of the apartment building. There are usually a few retired seniors chatting there (open zone). This group of people gathers there almost every afternoon to share their views on social issues and daily life. Their discussions are often heated and accompanied by arguments. For them, talking is not only a form of daily lively communication but also a form of critical participation. They are accustomed to expressing their views on social phenomena directly, unafraid of controversy, and not shying away from conflict. The most notable is Mr. Wu, who is present every day. He speaks directly and loudly, often taking the lead in discussing news commentary, policy trends, and social issues.

      For Jake, such sounds and images should not appear in his after-work world. His Bluetooth Emotional Purification headset automatically identifies content with high emotional fluctuations, reducing these sounds to the level of background noise and retaining only calm music to accompany him. On the visual side, the system slightly blurs intense movements or exaggerated expressions, making the scene appear more peaceful. Over time, he no longer looks at that area, seeing it simply as a small open zone without emotional purification.

    Jake stood still, his heart racing. He couldn't figure out whether that remark was aimed at him, but his nerves were already stretched to the limit. He subconsciously touched Bluetooth Emotional Purification headset and pressed the function bar on the frame of his glasses, as if doing that would miraculously restore the system, but nothing happened. At that moment, Jake abruptly lost emotional control. All the frustration, silence, and repression he had felt throughout the day poured out like an uncontrollable tide after he said those words. ‚ÄúWhat do you know? You don't have to work overtime every day, you don't have to worry about what your clients think, and you don't have to worry about getting fired!‚Äù His voice trembled and his eyes reddened.
    <br><br>

    ‚ÄúI just don't want to be crushed by these voices anymore!‚Äù The air fell silent for a few seconds. The elderly people stopped talking and turned to look at him. Some frowned, while others looked surprised. After a few seconds of silence, Mr. Wu calmly replied, "I understand what you just said. Young people indeed carry more invisible pressures than our generation. "But have you ever considered that the voices you're trying so hard to block out are actually a genuine part of this world? If we see every differing opinion as an attack and every emotional reaction as a burden, we'll slowly lose touch with the world‚Äôs true face and maybe even grow afraid to face it."

    <br><br>
     Jake didn't respond, just lowered his head. He knew Mr. Wu wasn't entirely wrong, but accepting it wouldn't be easy for him. He realised perhaps this was the generational gap between them. Older people were accustomed to facing the conflicts and complexities of reality, participating in society through direct speech, and expressing their views. However, their generation, having been subjected to workplace pressures and a high intensity pace of life for a long time, was more likely to rely on emotional purification techniques to wrap and isolate their emotions. Before leaving, he glanced at Mr. Wu and gave a slight nod, both as a thanks and a farewell. He turned and walked toward the apartment building, his steps slow. Without the effect of the emotion filter, the real sounds remained vivid. A child was talking in the hallway, someone was speaking softly on the phone about work, and there was the sound of a TV program. Normally, he would have found these noises annoying, but now he didn't instinctively cover his ears. Perhaps the system would be restored soon, and he would be able to return to his familiar emotional purification lifestyle. But tonight, even if only for one night, he decided to listen to these unprocessed sounds and treat them as an experience rather than a burden.
