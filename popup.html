    <h2>When the Filter Went Offline</h2>
    
    <p>Once, Jake experienced his most serious project failure at work. After the client suddenly rejected the advertising proposal, the colleague in charge shifted the blame onto him, so his leader reprimanded him in front of everyone. He spent the entire afternoon feeling depressed and wronged, unable to speak a word. After work, he just wanted to get into noise-cancelling mode as quickly as possible, shutting everything out like usual. But when he put on his glasses and headphones, the device popped up a message: Emotional purification system under maintenance, estimated recovery time: 7 hours. Jake froze for a few seconds, repeatedly clicking to confirm, then restarted the system, but there was still no response. Having rarely encountered such situations and never expecting it to happen today, Jake forced himself to remain calm even as anxiety began to rise inside. He tried to recall when the system was last updated and whether there were any backup devices. He even considered contacting customer service for help, but the thought only made him feel more helpless. </p>
   
    <p>That night, the world felt unusually real, and the echo of subway announcements, conversations between passengers, and the loud arguments blaring from other people's phones poured into his ears without the system's filtering. As he passed by the area where the elderly often gathered for rest, Mr. Wu's voice came through clearly. He was talking about a news story from that night and said, “Young people today can't stand any disagreement and claim their feelings are hurt at the slightest conflict, but the reality isn't a filter made for you.” Jake suddenly stopped. He had passed by here before, but this was the first time he had heard them so clearly.</p>
