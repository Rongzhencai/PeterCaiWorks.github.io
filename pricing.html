    <h2 class="sectiontitle">Background Context</h2>
    <p class="sectiontext">
      In 2032, some technology companies notice that urban residents are generally experiencing emotional fatigue. So, they launch monthly subscription services for emotional purification. However, most companies do not allow employees to wear related devices during work hours to avoid affecting work efficiency. Therefore, most people only use them after work as a daily emotional regulation method.
      <strong>This system is particularly tailored for young employees who face high-pressure environments and need emotional relief after work.</strong>

    <h2 class="sectiontitle">User Case: Jake</h2>
    <p class="sectiontext">
      Jake, 24 years old, is a young person who has just entered the workforce for less than two years. During the day, he works in an advertising company in the city, facing fast-paced work tasks and sudden instructions from clients, often feeling physically and mentally exhausted.
    </p>
    <p class="sectiontext">
      As soon as he gets off work, he always immediately puts on the glasses, AirPods and watch of the emotional purification system, and enters his noise-filtered lifestyle.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectiontitle">System Features</h2>
    <p class="sectiontext">
      The system automatically filters out quarrels on the subway, loudspeakers on the street, and ridicule and criticism in social interactions. Some words are replaced with neutral expressions, and intense emotional expressions and actions in the scenes are slightly blurred. Everything that Jake sees and hears is the calm version adjusted by algorithms. Only in such an environment can he feel protected and complete.
